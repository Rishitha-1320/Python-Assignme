#Assignment 3

##Task1:
-Calculate Factorrial using Function
-Take a input from the user
-def a function for factorial
-using for loop to find the factorial
-assigning fact as 1,so each value of i gets multiplied to give factorial
-opening for loop with range 1 to n+1
-next line is incrementing the fact value with fact multiplid with i each time (n+1) times
-returing fact value
-calling the function as result
-printing result


##Task2
-using math module for calculation
-import math to perform the mathematical operation
-taking input from user
-printing the result using particular module for each math operation
-square root
-log
-sine
